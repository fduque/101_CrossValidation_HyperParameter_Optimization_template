# Using KNN and RFC to predict Wine Quality.

Project made just for POC purposes.

Steps deployed:
1.   Train KNN model
2.   Train RFC model
3.   Apply Cross Validation (using accuracy metric)
4.   Tunning some parameters using GridSearCV (using Accuracy metric)
5.   Comparing the gains after tunning phase using Acurracy Score.

Final Results:
Model 1 - Random Forest - Score (Accuracy before vs Accuracy after) : 0.9815 0.9833

Model 2 - KNN - Score (before vs after) : 0.7037 0.7251
